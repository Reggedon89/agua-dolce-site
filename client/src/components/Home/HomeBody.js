            The most visible set at S.O.S is our L10-11, full size, jet
            fuselage. The interior is vintage 1974, complete with ashtrays. As
            constructed L10-11 bathrooms were at the very rear of the plane in a
            curved row. All we did is bring the row of bathrooms forward so it's
            easy to film both inside and outside the bathrooms.
